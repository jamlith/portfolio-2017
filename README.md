### _2017 Portfolio_ ([githubpages.io](https://portfolio-2017.githubpages.io/)):
This is a collection of the work that I have done using many different languages and frameworks, most of it being assignments I completed while
attending a coding bootcamp through George Washington University, which I
completed in the beggining of October 2017.  Most of the pure javascript/css based projects were created to very specific rules regarding style and layout.  I mention this mainly because I can't stand the colors/style rules for some of the projects, and would be embarassed if someone thought I was fully responsible for such a thing... 

I have altered some of the project names, opting for what i believe are more professional choices.  I will also re-create the layouts, and show you what I came up with to make them pretty to look at and ultra-functional.  This will be as I find the spare time to do so.  I will make notes alerting you to the changes I made, and provide you with the originals for comparison. 

I also changed some of the terminology and language I was stuck using due to the rules provided with the assignment... (a quick example:  the project 'Burger Project' was originally named 'Eat-Da-Burger', and was required to have cartoony fonts and colors... It was one of the projects that I poured a more-than-normal amount of my style into, animating alot of the create/destroy element events, and using a 60fps wireframe wormhole as the background for one of the panels.)
